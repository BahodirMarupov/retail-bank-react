A React demo project I've made using CreateReactApp template.

* Organized components into three categories: domain, common and auth.
* Created http services for each domain model.
* I've used AXIOS for my making my HTTP requests. In the past I've used the native APIs like Fetch API and the older AJAX API but I've wanted something cleaner for this project.
* Created auth services. I use `jwt-decode` to work with JWT tokens.
* Used React Router for navigation.
* Used React Toastify for displaying toast messages.

Not much else to say here...
